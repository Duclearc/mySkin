**<h1>mySkin</h1>**
MySkin was a German project I participated in with the goal of helping prevent skin cancer. This app's highlights include:
* the user is able to upload a photo of their birthmarks and it's cancerous likelihood gets calculated on device.
* the user has access to informations on skin cancer and how to prevent it.
* the user has access to a reminder function, where they can input their next checkup appointment and the app will display a countdown to remind them of it.
* the user get's their location's current UV index displayed to them upon opening the app, and the recommended care (sunscreen, use of hats, etc) is informed accordingly.
* the user gets access to a forum where they can access questions from other users on various topics, as well as insert (and delete) their own queries and answers, mark their favourites and search by keywords.
* the user has access to a favourites section where their favourite questions are displayed to them separately. This section also includes a search function which will search keywords present in their favourite questions.

These are some of the highlights of this wonderful app. A project I'm very proud to have been a part of. Not only because it was a joy to work in, but also for the distinction of being the first Machine Learning mobile app developed entirely on JavaScript and processed on device, in according to GDPR privacy concerns.

**And all that between 4 people in one and half weeks!**
